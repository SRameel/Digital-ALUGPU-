Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) Design & Implementation in VHDL

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to design, construct, and simulate an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) within a VHDL environment and subsequently implement it on an FPGA board. 

The project encompasses:

Comprehensive design and construction of all ALU functions.
Design and simulation of the ALU using VHDL, leveraging the Functional Simulation capabilities of the Quartus Simulator.
Project Overview & Components:
The ALU is a composite of various components that, when synergized, result in a fully functional ALU. A typical processing unit is segmented into four distinct components:

Control Unit: This component is responsible for fetching instructions and emitting the necessary signals for the ALU's operations.
Bus: The bus manages access to data values across the processing unit, ensuring smooth data flow and communication between different parts of the ALU.
Registers: These are temporary storage units within the processing unit. They hold data values that the ALU operates upon or produces as outputs.
ALU Core: The heart of the system, the ALU Core, performs the arithmetic and logical operations based on the provided inputs and produces the desired outputs.
This project delves deep into the intricacies of all four components, ensuring a holistic understanding and development of a typical ALU.
